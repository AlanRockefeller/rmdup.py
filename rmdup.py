# Version 1.1
# By Alan Rockefeller - March 30, 2025

# This script recursively looks for duplicate files in the current directory and offers to delete them.
# If you give it the -i option it asks about each file - if you don't it lists all the files it plans to delete and lets you decide if you want to go ahead.

# It prioritizes deleting duplicate newer files and those with parenthesis, as these are often extra files that were downloaded or saved, and it's usually best to keep the original filename rather than the one with (1) or (2), etc.

Find and delete duplicate files in a directory and its subdirectories.

This script identifies duplicate files by calculating MD5 checksums and offers 
to delete redundant copies, helping you free up disk space while keeping only 
one copy of each unique file.

How It Works:
- Files with identical content (same MD5 checksum) are grouped together
- For each group of duplicate files, the script recommends which copies to delete
- You must confirm before any deletions occur

File Selection Strategy:
When identical files are found, the script uses these rules to suggest which 
copies to keep and which to delete:

1. Files with parentheses in their names (like 'document (1).pdf' or 'image (copy).jpg')
   are suggested for deletion, while files without parentheses are kept. This is because
   files with parentheses are typically auto-generated copies created by browsers or
   file systems.

2. If no files have parentheses (or all files have parentheses), the script suggests
   keeping the oldest file (by modification time) and deleting the newer copies.

Safety:
The script NEVER automatically deletes files without confirmation. You will 
always be prompted before any deletion occurs.
